# User Guide

This guide explains how to use the tldraw application within Nextcloud.

## Creating a New Drawing

1.  Navigate to the **Files** app in Nextcloud.
2.  Click the **+ New** button in the top bar.
3.  Select **New tldraw drawing**.
4.  Enter a name for your drawing (e.g., `Brainstorm.tldr`) and press Enter.

The new file will be created and automatically opened in the editor.

## Editing & Tools

The editor provides a standard tldraw interface:
-   **Toolbar (Bottom):** Select tools like Select, Hand, Draw, Eraser, Shapes, Arrows, and Text.
-   **Menu (Top Left):** Access file options, preferences, and view settings.
-   **Zoom/Pan:** Use the mouse wheel to zoom, or hold Spacebar + Click and Drag to pan around the canvas.

## Real-Time Collaboration

Collaboration is automatic!
1.  **Share the File:** Use Nextcloud's native sharing sidebar to share the `.tldr` file with other users or groups.
2.  **Open Together:** When multiple users open the file, you will see each other's cursors in real-time.
3.  **Permissions:**
    -   **Can edit:** Users with edit permission can draw and modify the canvas.
    -   **Read only:** Users with read-only permission can view the drawing but cannot make changes.

## Exporting

To save your drawing as an image:
1.  Click the **Menu** button (top left).
2.  Select **Export**.
3.  Choose your format (SVG, PNG, JSON, etc.).
    -   *Note: This downloads the file to your computer, not to Nextcloud.*

## Inserting Images

You can upload images directly onto the canvas:
1.  **Drag and Drop:** Drag an image file from your computer directly onto the browser window.
2.  **Copy and Paste:** Copy an image to your clipboard and press `Ctrl+V` (or `Cmd+V`) to paste it.

Images are securely uploaded to your Nextcloud storage and embedded in the drawing.
